    <h2>The 1962 War Stats</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>On October 20, 1962, China's People's Liberation Army invaded India in Ladakh, and across the McMahon Line in the then North-East Frontier Agency.</li>
        <li>Till the start of the war, the Indian side was confident that war would not be started and made little preparations. Thinking this, India deployed only two divisions of troops in the region of the conflict, while the Chinese troops had three regiments positioned.</li>
        <li>The Chinese also cut Indian telephone lines, preventing the defenders from making contact with their headquarters.</li>
        <li>On the first day, the Chinese infantry also launched an attack from the rear. The continued losses forced the Indian troops to escape to Bhutan.</li>
        <li>On October 22, the Chinese lighted a bush which caused a lot of confusion among the Indians. Some 400 Chinese troops attacked the Indian position. The initial Chinese assault was stopped by accurate Indian mortar fire.</li>
        <li>When the Indian army discovered that a Chinese force gathered in a pass, it opened fire with mortars and machine guns and killed about 200 Chinese soldiers.</li>
        <li>On October 26, a patrol from the 4th Sikhs was encircled, and after they were unable to break the encirclement, an Indian unit sneaked in and attacked the Chinese army and freed the Sikhs.</li>
        <li>According to China's official military history, the war achieved China's policy objectives of securing borders in its western sector.</li>
